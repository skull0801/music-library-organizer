# music-library-organizer
Very simple script that puts songs in a folder into subfolders for their respective artists.

#HOW TO USE
All you need to do is give a path and a string that will be the separator for the artist name and song title (everything before that is the artist name, and everything after that is the song's title), it will then, for each song in that folder (not for the subfolders) create a folder with the artist name and move the songs there.


#IMPORTANT:
If you're not sure about how it will separate them, please test on a copy.
There is a "deorganizer", but I'm not sure if it will behave exactly the way you'd expect.
